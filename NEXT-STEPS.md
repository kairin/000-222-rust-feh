# Next steps for 000-222-rust-feh

**Status:** to do. Nothing on this page is done yet.
**Source:** the architecture review of 2026-10-07. The full plan is in
`000-0-workspace/docs/alignment-plan-2026-10-07.md`. The index of all
repositories is `000-0-workspace/docs/next-steps.md`.
**Task:** T10. **Work branch:** make a new branch from `main`, for example
`docs/rhel10-followup`, and open a new pull request. The branch names and
pull-request numbers inside the task text below were merged on 2026-10-07.
Do not reuse them.
**Depends on:** nothing. **Needs the owner (user-gated):** no.

When all the steps are done and verified, delete this file in the same pull request.

## The current plan (binding)

- RHEL 10.2 is the primary operating system: GNOME, Ptyxis, `dnf`, Podman, SELinux, bash.
- **bash is the only shell.** fish is retired (review decision N1). bash gets fish-like tools: `ble.sh`, `bash-completion`, `atuin`, `fzf`, `zoxide`, `starship` (amendment A1, below).
- EPEL 10 is required. It gives `pass`, `fzf`, `uv`, `ripgrep`, `podman-compose` and ShellCheck.
- `000-0-dotfiles` and `000-0-workspace` are documentation only. The other core repositories hold documents and product files only. They have no installer, no engine and no tests of removed code.
- Keys are in the `pass` store. A command gets a key only through `with-secret` (`000-0-password`). `~/.dotfiles/` and `~/Apps/.envrc` do not exist.
- One askpass helper: `~/.local/bin/askpass.sh` (zenity). `ksshaskpass` is not used.
- Do not keep a file only because it records the past. Git history keeps it.

## Review findings for this repository

**000-222-rust-feh #170** (comment only)
- `scripts/sudo-askpass.sh:17,19` contradicts the new comment and prints `sudo -A apt install feh`; installs a second helper `~/.local/bin/sudo-askpass`; `scripts/sudo-askpass-bin.sh:11` apt; `.envrc.example:3,8`, `.envrc.local.example:8-30`; `README.md:39,51,91-96`; `src/tool_caps.rs:143,154`, `src/ui_logic.rs:17`, `src/main.rs:308` apt messages; `CHANGELOG.md:7` now false (says dotfiles owns `~/.bashrc.d`). Fix: T10 (use the shared `askpass.sh`; RHEL = `dnf install rust cargo` + feh/ImageMagick from EPEL).

## Task

**T10 — 000-222-rust-feh** (`docs/rhel10-alignment`, PR #170)
Steps: 1. Delete `scripts/sudo-askpass.sh` and `scripts/sudo-askpass-bin.sh`; `.envrc.example` → `source_env_if_exists .envrc.local` only; `.envrc.local.example` → S2; README: replace the askpass section with "`sudo -A` uses `~/.local/bin/askpass.sh` from `000-0-dotfiles/docs/configuration-reference.md`". 2. README `:39,51,91-96`: RHEL first: `sudo dnf install rust cargo` (AppStream 1.92, no `-devel` packages needed — verified from Cargo.lock), `feh` and ImageMagick from EPEL (`sudo dnf install feh ImageMagick`), then the Ubuntu lines. 3. `src/tool_caps.rs:143,154`, `src/ui_logic.rs:17`, `src/main.rs:308`: message → "install feh (RHEL/EPEL: sudo dnf install feh; Ubuntu: sudo apt install feh)" and the ImageMagick equivalent; update any test that asserts the old string (`grep -rn 'apt install' src tests`). 4. `scripts/validate-009-quickstart-hints.sh:44`, `scripts/capture-app-screenshot.sh:13`, `docs/MAGICK-CACHE-SETUP.md:5,17,20,153,154`: add dnf lines. 5. `CHANGELOG.md`: new entry; fix line 7 to "the shell snippets are documented in 000-0-dotfiles (bash)". 6. Note in README: feh is X11 and runs under Xwayland; `capture-app-screenshot.sh` needs an X11 session.
Verification: `cargo` absent locally → cannot build; run `grep -rn 'sudo apt' src` → only inside combined messages; CI `ci` + CodeQL green on the PR (CI builds on Ubuntu).

## Shared text used by this task

**S2. `.envrc.local.example` replacement (whole file):**
```bash
# .envrc.local: settings for this computer only. Git ignores it.
# Secrets are NOT put here. A command gets a secret from the pass store
# through with-secret (see ~/Apps/000-0-password). Example:
#   with-secret github/mcp -- <command>
# Put only non-secret local values below, for example:
# export DATA_DIR="$HOME/data/<project>"
```
And in `.envrc`: delete the `source_up` line and any comment that names `~/Apps/.envrc`; if the file then has no content, keep the line `source_env_if_exists .envrc.local`.

**S9. Commit/PR rules for every worker.** Commit on the named branch only; `git push -u origin <branch>`; open the PR with `gh pr create` if none exists, else `gh pr edit --body` to append a "Follow-up 2026-10-07" section. Every commit message ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`; every PR body ends with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`. Never push to `main`, never merge. Docs in ASD-STE100 style: short sentences, active voice, one idea per sentence. Add a dated CHANGELOG entry where the repo has a CHANGELOG. In 000-0-ASD-STE100 never write the purge words.


## Amendment A1 (owner decision, 2026-10-07): bash with fish-like tools

The owner confirmed decision N1: **bash is the shell.** The owner also said:
"must install the relevant tools that makes bash functionally the same as
fish". This amendment replaces the "Rejected: … ble.sh …" sentence of N1.
Where this amendment and a task disagree, this amendment wins.

| fish feature | bash tool | Source on RHEL 10 |
|---|---|---|
| Suggestions from history while you type | `ble.sh` | Upstream release, user space (`~/.local/share/blesh`) |
| Syntax colours on the command line | `ble.sh` | Same |
| Tab completion with a menu | `bash-completion` + `ble.sh` | `bash-completion` is installed (BaseOS) |
| Abbreviations (`abbr`) | `ble-sabbrev` in `ble.sh` | Same |
| History search (`Ctrl+R`) | `atuin` | EPEL 10 (18.12) |
| File and folder pickers (`Ctrl+T`, `Alt+C`) | `fzf` | EPEL 10 |
| `z` to jump to folders | `zoxide` | Upstream, `~/.local/bin` |
| Prompt | `starship` | Upstream, `~/.local/bin` |
| Per-folder environment | `direnv` | Upstream, `~/.local/bin` |

**Install `ble.sh` (no root):**

```bash
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh/releases/download/v0.4.0-devel3/ble-0.4.0-devel3.tar.xz | tar -xJf - -C "$tmp"
bash "$tmp/ble-0.4.0-devel3/ble.sh" --install ~/.local/share
rm -rf "$tmp"
```

Expect: `~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh` exists. Check for a newer release first:
`gh release view --repo akinomyoga/ble.sh --json tagName --jq .tagName`.

**Install `atuin` and `fzf`** (after EPEL, owner runs): `sudo dnf install atuin fzf`.

**`~/.bashrc.d/` snippets: changes to S6.** RHEL's `~/.bashrc` sources
`~/.bashrc.d/*` in name order. `ble.sh` must load first and attach last:

- `01-blesh.sh`: `[[ $- == *i* && -f ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh ]] && source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh --noattach`
- `40-fzf.sh` (changed): `if [[ $- == *i* ]] && command -v fzf >/dev/null 2>&1; then eval "$(fzf --bash)"; fi` — keep it; `atuin` takes `Ctrl+R` because it loads later.
- `50-atuin.sh`: `if [[ $- == *i* ]] && command -v atuin >/dev/null 2>&1; then eval "$(atuin init bash)"; fi`
- `60-abbr.sh`: `if [[ ${BLE_VERSION-} ]]; then ble-sabbrev g='git' gs='git status' gd='git diff' gc='git commit' gp='git push'; fi`
- `99-blesh-attach.sh`: `[[ ! ${BLE_VERSION-} ]] || ble-attach`

The other S6 files (`00-local-bin-path.sh`, `10-sudo-askpass.sh`,
`20-direnv.sh`, `30-starship.sh`, `45-zoxide.sh`) stay as they are. Total: ten
files.

**Expect** (new Ptyxis tab): grey suggestions appear while you type; the
command is coloured; `Ctrl+R` opens atuin; `z <name>` jumps; `g` + space
expands to `git`.

**Tasks that change because of A1:**
- **T01** (000-0-dotfiles): `configuration-reference.md` bash section has the
  ten snippets and the `ble.sh` install; `rhel-10-setup.md` tool table adds
  rows `ble.sh` (upstream) and `atuin` (EPEL), and `bash-completion`
  (installed); the README expect row says "ten files"; `decisions.md` records
  A1 with the fish-to-bash table above.
- **T02** (000-0-workspace): the site dotfiles page names the fish-like tools.
- **T26** (machine, user space): also install `ble.sh` and write the ten
  snippets.
- **T27** (owner, root): the `dnf install` line adds `atuin`.
